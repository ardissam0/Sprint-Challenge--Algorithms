#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - it is Linear because the difference between the range and the loop is n.


b) O(n log n) - it is Log Linear because the first part of the function is O(n), but the while loop pointer is doubled each loop.


c)O(n) - it is Linear because the function will increment linearly as the value increases.

## Exercise II
